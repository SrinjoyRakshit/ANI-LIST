The first season follows his exploits as a revenge-driven Viking, while in the second season, the story shifts to his life as a stoic slave who finds no reason to live.Despite the two seasons being developed by two different studios, director Shūhei Yabuta and writer Hiroshi Seko worked together in both parts. They aimed to bring the adaptation more original content in order to further develop the characters like Thorfinn's transformation into a Viking, his nightmares that haunt him, and Einar's life before turning into a slave.

                        <P class="card_para">The Monster anime series adapts Naoki Urasawa's manga of the same name. The 74-episode series was created by Madhouse and broadcast on Nippon Television from April 7, 2004, to September 28, 2005. Directed by Masayuki Kojima, it is a faithful adaptation of the entire story; essentially recreated shot for shot and scene for scene compared to the original manga. The few subtle differences include short snippets of additional dialogue and slight re-ordering of scenes in places. The series soundtrack is composed by Kuniaki Haishima</P>
